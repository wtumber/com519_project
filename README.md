# COM517 Plan
1.	Document/Guide management and recall system

b.	Stores recommended guides by users
c.	Datashape
i.	Title
ii.	Author (Author)
iii.	Material format (blog/book/e-book/training course)
iv.	Language/Key Theme (Python/R): Multiple choice, ability to add others
v.	Refer to this guide for:
vi.	Theme 1
vii.	Theme 2 (Optional)
viii.	Price (Optional)
ix.	Brief summary
x.	Review (*/7)
d.	Allows aggregation by the guide type, see best reviewed guides, filter by theme, add new guide
e.	Very relevant - many organisations found themselves moving away from training in data science through Datacamp, and sought alternative solutions. Likewise, people looking to upskill in their own time would begrudge paying for expensive monthly licenses when there are an abundance of free resources. This highlights a clear need for this product.
f.	Anecdotally, I have found myself with easily 100+ open tabs on my phone with guides, adding guides to the reading list, bookmarking tabs on Medium, etc. These are all useful in isolation but make effective sharing across an organisation/ group difficult



### Notes
I was keen to move away from populating the json as quickly as possible, as it diminished the point of the application.
